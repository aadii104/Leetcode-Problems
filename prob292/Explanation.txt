Approach 1 :- (dp Approach).

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).

In this we are using a dp array to store the result of all the states from 1 to n, and for determining the current 
state result we will check the last 3 states that if any of last 3 state if false than we will land at that poisition
by removing respective stones and than the array will represent that from this state the person who plays from this 
will definately looses game and hence now it's opponent turn hence he will loose the game, so in this what we are doing 
is that if any of last 3 contains False than we will win the game else we will loose the game , so in this we are
checking only for the last three and at last return the value store at n-1 index.

Approach 2 :- (Math).

Time Complexity:-O(1).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

On observation of above approach it is found that if number of stones are multiple of 4 than we will loose the game
else we can win it.

Observation:-

For n=20;
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
T, T, T, F, T, T, T, F, T, T,  T,  F,  T,  T,  T,  F,  T,  T,  T,  F.

         ^           ^             ^               ^               ^. --> On thses Places we can loose the game.
                                                                          As the places where we loose the game are multiple of 4 hence if number of stones are multiple of 4 we will return false representing that we loose the game else return true which represents that we win the game.
