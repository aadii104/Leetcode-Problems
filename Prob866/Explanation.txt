Approach 1:-

In this approach what we are going to do is that we will try to generate all the pallindromes starting from the 1 and check that is these are primes 
or not. If these are found to be prime and are greater than or equa to the given N than we can return this number else check for the next. The 
important point to note here is that if the number is a even pallindrome other than 11 than it can't be a prime number hence we will not check for 
the even pallindromes and will check only for the odd pallindromes.
