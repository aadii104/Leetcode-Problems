Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).

As by observation it is found that on reversing the string and adding it to the front part makes it a palindrome. But this is not the shortest 
palindrome as we want. But on observation the part which occurs extra one in the resultant string is found to the longest prefix which is also 
suffix of the string s + reverse(s). So we will use KMP table to found the length of the suffix which is also a prefix. After getting this we will 
remove that part of the string and join the rest of the string to the beginning of the string, and hence we are with our result.
