Approach 1 :-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

In this we are using simple technique to itterate the string in which we are traversing the string only ones but with three for loops. The outer loops runs
til the itterator reaches the end of the string whih the first inner loop travesr for untill nonempty space character arrises if itterator move forward than 
we will increment the value of result by 1 as it represents increment in counter else if the tring after itterator is like "    " than their is no segment 
hence we have no need to increase the result counter. The next inner for loop runs till we will not encounter non space character and by doing this we itterates
the whole string and have result in our hand.
