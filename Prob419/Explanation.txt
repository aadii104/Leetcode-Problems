Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N*M).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

As we know that we have a lot of solutions to easily solve this problem, but it was clearly mentioned in the question that "Could you do it in 
one-pass, using only O(1) extra memory and without modifying the value of the board?". So we are solving this question according to the given 
constraints. 

On observing it was found that if we encounter with a 'X' character and if it has no 'X' character to it's left and top and it shows that it is the 
beginning of the new battelship and hence we have a new battelship to count. But if the current 'X' character has another 'X' character to it's left 
or top than it represents that it is part of another battelship which is counted earlier hence we are not counting this one and go for the next to 
check.

So we are itterating the given board ones and are not using extra memory to solve the problem and also not modifying the value of the board , hence 
we follow all the given constraints.
