Approach 1:-

In this approach we are initially taking the total count of the non Obstacle elements and than than we will start from the stating position in all 4 
directions, if the elements in any of the directions is a obstacle(-1) or already visited one(denoted by -2 in the code) than we will non go to that 
place and return from their. Now as traversing we are also taking count of the current non-obstacle elements, now on traversing if we will reach the 
end position(2) than we will check that is the current non obstacles are equal to total non-obstacles, if it is than it is a valid path and hence we 
will increase the result counter and return from their. So by doing this we can traverse the whole area and caluclate the valid number of paths.
