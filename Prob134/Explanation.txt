Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

According to the question we can say that if we are at index i than the cost to move to i+1 index is equal to gas[i]-cost[i]. So in this we are only 
conserned only with this. Here cost at index denotes gas[i]-cost[i].  So now we will start to itterate the gas array. As we are itterating we will 
store the total cost used , if the total cost is found to be less than 0 than we can't move to the stations and hence we will return -1, but if it 
is not than at each pass of station we will add the cost of index i to current cost, if the current cost is found to be less than zero than it shows 
that we can not start from anywhere from back index or current index, so let start from i+1 index and with current cost equal to 0. Now we will 
calculate the current cost from i+1 index, If at any further index j it again becomes less than 0 than we will again start from j+1 index. Now if 
the solution exist than the first index after which current cost will not become zero is the answer as it was clearly mentioned that their is only 
unique solution to the question hence we are free to do so.
