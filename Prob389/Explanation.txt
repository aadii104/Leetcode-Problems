Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N+M)
Space Complexity:-O(N).

In this approach we are using an unordered map to store the letters and their count in given string s. Now we will start to itterate the second 
string, now if any character arrises which is not present in map than we can say that this is the new added character or if count of any character 
in t is found to be greater than count in s than we can say that this is the new added character and return that one as final answer.

Approach 2:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

As we know that string t is formed from shuffling characters of string s hence we can say that the each character of string s occurs even number of 
times in combined string of s and t. Also we know that XOR of same operands result to 1 so in this we will try to take XOR of all the characters. 
The result of this XOR gives the newely character added as all the previous occuring characters occurs even times and hence thier XOR results into 1 
and XOR of 1 and any character results into that character and hence we can say the the result stores the new added character.
