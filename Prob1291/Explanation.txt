Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N). Where N is the difference of length of high number and low number.
Space Complexity:-O(1).

In this Approach min_len represents the min length required for digits and max_len represents max length required for digits. Also we have a digits 
string which store all digits in sequential order. Now initially we are taking current length equal to min_len and starting digit to 1 so we form a 
number of length min_len starting from 1. Now we will check that is that number is greater than low and smaller than high or not. If it is than we 
will add that to list and check for number of current length as min_len and starting with 2 and check for this one and so on. Now when we are done 
with all number of length min_len than we will go for length min_len+1 and check the same for that one and so on. After done all with these we have 
answer in a arr so we can return that one as final answer.
