Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).

Few terms to introduce are:-

1) res-> Final Result.
2) num-> The current number formed on which we are working that is 2 or 5 or 35 or 1412 etc.
3) sign-> The sign of number on which we are working.
4) store-> This is a stack used to store the results in parenthesis.

In this problem depanding upon the following conditions we are taking the steps as discussed. 

1) If the current character is a digit :-
    Now in this situation we will add the current character to the num by adding it to ones place and shifting other digit 1 step to left that is 
    multiplying it with 10 and than adding the current digit.

2) If current character is either + or - :-
    So in this situation we have done all with the previous number except adding it to result. So on facing this situation we will add the number to 
    the final result with it's corresponding sign and than starting with a new number as 0 and sign according to + or -.

3) If current character is '(' :-
    This implies the beginnning of a new string. So we will just push the previous string result in a stack and than start from beginning to 
    calculate the result for the current or new imaginary string. After done all with this string that is on encounter with corresponding colsing 
    parenthesis ')' we have done with this string so add that to the result and continue the to original string.

4) If the current character is ')' :-
    It implies the end of the current or imaginary string so we will add the result of that string to the original result and continue for the 
    further string.

At last we will return res as the final answer.
