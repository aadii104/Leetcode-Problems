Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).

In this approach what we are going to do is that we are forming an another linked list to store the list of size 
equal to mamimum of the both the given list . Now what we are going is that we will first calculate the sum of 1st
node's value of list , if it goes greater than 9 than we have a carry 1 to add to next node and than we will put 
sum%10 value to the result list's first node , than we will check for the second node and so on.

Now what if any list terminate first than the loop remains continue and the value taken from this list is 0 and hence 
now we are just adding only one list.

At last we will also check that is the value of carry is greater than 0 or not, if it is than we will add another 
node at the end of reult list to store that carry otherwise we will simply return the list.
