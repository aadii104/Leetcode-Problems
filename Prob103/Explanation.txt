Approach 1 :- 

Time Complexiy:-O(N).
Space Complexiy:-O(N).

In this question we are going to use the concept of level order traversal in some optimised way using two stack. The first stack is used to store the nodes 
on add depth in left to right direcction uch that top most node represents the left most node, while the secons stack store the nodes of even depth (1 index)
nodes in right to left direction , so in a case we will first fill first stack and than make it empty by filling second stack and also storing our result
after this we will make second stack empty with stooring result and filling first stack in order and so on.
