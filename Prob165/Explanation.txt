Approch 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).

So in this Problem what we are going to do is that we will itterate both the strings simultaneously and than extract the first number formed from 
there and compare them. If anyone is greater than we will return the value according to given conditions in the question. But if both have same 
value than we will check for the next version of number and compare them and so on till anyone string does not terminates or any version becomes 
greater than other. If any one of the string terminates first than we will check that is any further version of number formed with the other string 
is 0 or not. If it is not zero than it implies that both versions are not equal and hence will return value according to it. But if all further 
versons are 0 than we will return 0 as both versions are equal.
