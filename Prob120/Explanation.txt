Approach 1:-  (Time Limit Exceeded)

Time Complexity:-O(2^N).
Space Complexity:-O(2^N).

In this approach what we are going to do is that we will try all the possible combinations and than extract out the sum which has minimum value.This 
approach can be termed as Brute Force as we are generating all the possible combinations and search all of them.
