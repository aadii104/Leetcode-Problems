Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).

In this approach what we are doing is like summing up the integers as we did in our juniour class that is first add the last digit of both string 
and store the result and take our carry from there, after this we go from last to first element by doing the basic process. Finally we have result 
in another string and we can return that one.
