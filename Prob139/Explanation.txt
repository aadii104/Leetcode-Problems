Time Complexity:-O(N^2).
Space Complexity:-O(N+M).

In this we are using an unordered set to store the words of dict because we are going to match the substring from these words and hence it will be 
helpful if we are going to use set so that we can reduce the time complexity for searching. 

Now In this problem we are going to use dynamic programming approach in which we are going to divide the problem into sub-problems. Also we are 
using an array whose indices tell us that is the substring of length current index from index 0 can be formed from the given words in dict. So by 
this we are going to divide problem into sub problems. At last the value at index n of the dp array will tell us the result.
