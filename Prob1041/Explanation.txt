Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

In this approach we are using a vector of size 4 which is used to store the number of steps along various directions. Here index 0 for North, 1 for 
east, 2 for South, and 3 for West. Now initially we are facing towards north, so out direction index should be 0. Now we will start to traverse the 
string, if the current character is G than we will increase one step towards current direction, But if current character is other than G than we 
will change the direction according to it. Also we will take count of the total steps we have taken. Now if the total steps taken are 0 or after 
traversing the string we are not facing towards north or if we return to our initial position facing in any direction than we can say that robot 
never leaves the circle. So if any of the 3 condition become true than we will return true else return false.
