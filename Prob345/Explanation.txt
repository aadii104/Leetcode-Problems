Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

In this problem we are going to use two pointers approach according to which one pointer points to start point and the other one represents the end 
points. Now we will start to find the first vowel from the start and the end and than swap both of them after this we will find the next vowels and 
swap them and do this process untill start pointer becomes greater than end pointer. As in this appraoch we are doing all operations on given string 
and we are not using any extra space so the space Complexity is O(1) and we are traversing the string only ones results into time Complexity equal 
to O(N).

Note as we are using extra space in checking that is the character is vowel or not does not changes space Complexity as it is fixed for all the test 
cases.
