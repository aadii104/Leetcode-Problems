Approach 1 :- (No iterator class is used.)

Time Complexity:-O(N). 
Space Complexity:-O(N).

In this approach we are using a deque to store the element in given order and on each query we will return answer from the front.

peek function:-
    In this we will return the element at the front of the deque without removing the front element.

next function:-
    We will remove the top element and than return that one.

hasNext function:-
    If the deque is empty than it reprsents that no next element is present hence we will retrun false otherwise we will return true.


Approach 2 :- (Using Predefined Iterator class)

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).

In this approach we will use a Predefined class iterator which has all these functions already written in that so we will diresctly use them.
