Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

According to the question there are only two types of characters present in the system that is first character ('0') and second character('10','11').
Now when we are start to traverse the given array represented by several bits, if the present character becomes equal to 1 than it represents that 
the character formed using this bit is of second type and hence we can shift our pointer two steps forward as the length of second character is 2. 
But if the present character is 0 than it is of first type and hence we can shift our pointer only 1 step forward. So by doing this we can traverse 
the whole array. Now by travseing if the pointer reaches the N-1 index of array directly that is it doesnt't skip this index than we can say the the 
last character is of type first and hence we will return true. But if the pointer reaches the N-2 index and the bit found their is 1 than in that 
situation the pointer shifts two steps forward and hence the pointer reaches end of the array by skipping the N-1 index.So in that situation the 
last characteris of type second and hence we will return false.
