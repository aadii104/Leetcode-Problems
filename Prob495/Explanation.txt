Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

On observation it was found that if the difference between time of any two successive interval is less than duration that in that case total duration
is not considered else the time difference is considered. So in that case we will count that time in our answer, but if the duration is found to be 
less than in that case we will count the duration as time of attack. So in this what we have seen is that between any two successive time difference 
the time of injury considered is equal to minimum of the duration and their difference so we will count that one for our answer. So in this problem 
we will reun a loop over the array and than count the min of duration and difference in our answer and return that one as final answer.

Now why this happening is a big question. This is because if we are considering the previous attack, and the next attack will occur after time 
greater than or equal to duration than in that stuation the effect of attack will remain active for time interval equal to duration so in that case 
the time added to answer will be equal to duration(min of difference and duration is duration so it is added). Now on other situation if the current 
attack occured before completion of duration for previous attack than in that situation the impact of previous attack remains active only for 
difference duration and after that time interval time count of new attack will started from zero, so in that situation we will add the difference 
duration to result(min of difference and duration is difference so it is added). So by this we can say that we will add the minimum of difference 
and duration to final result.
